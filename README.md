# ButterMyHelper bot
Discord bot created for my friend's discord server using python- which provides several useful tools and interactions. It allows users to: 
- Play 8 ball
- Flip a coin
- Rotate images sent by users
- Keep track of debt by storing debts in a database, where details of the debt can be stored
- Set up reminders that allow the bot to send a notification to the user when the designated reminder time is reached
- Automatically emojify messages using NLP sentinment analysis provided by [emoji-translate](https://github.com/fabriceyhc/emoji_translate "Emoji translation for Python.")
